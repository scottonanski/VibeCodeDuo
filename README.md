# 🚀 VibeCodeDuo - Turn-Based Orchestrator: Revolutionizing AI Collaboration & Advancing Vibe Coding 🔥

Welcome to **VibeCodeDuo**, a cutting-edge platform that pioneers a **Turn-Based Orchestrator** for AI-driven software development! 🎉 We're moving beyond simple prompt-and-response AI into a **stateful, iterative pipeline** where specialized AI agents collaboratively **plan, scaffold, build, review, and refine** software projects—embodying and advancing the principles of **"vibe coding"** with enhanced structure and transparency.

## 💡 The Vision: Orchestrating Intelligent, Collaborative AI Development

VibeCodeDuo is engineered to simulate and augment a sophisticated software development lifecycle using multiple AI agents. Inspired by the "vibe coding" paradigm—where development is driven by natural language and iterative AI collaboration—we add layers of **specialization, review, and observable process** to create robust and high-quality software. Our customizable AI models (OpenAI & Ollama) work in distinct roles, pushing projects from ideation to tangible code.

### 🔑 Key Principles & How VibeCodeDuo Elevates "Vibe Coding"

*   **Specialized Multi-Agent Collaboration with Upfront Planning** 🧠💬🤖
    *   VibeCodeDuo employs a team of AI agents, each with a specific role, mirroring real-world development teams and addressing common "vibe coding" concerns about code quality:
        *   **Refiner Bot:** Ensures precise requirements by clarifying user prompts.
        *   **✨ Debate Duo (Debater A & Debater B, Summarizer):** Two AI agents (currently configurable to use Worker 1 & Worker 2 models) engage in critical discussions to propose and critique high-level implementation plans *before* any scaffolding or coding begins. A Summarizer AI then distills this debate into an `agreedPlan`, options, and identifies if further resolution is needed. This proactive planning mitigates issues like technical debt and improves architectural soundness.
        *   **Scaffolder AI:** Generates initial project file/folder structures based on the `agreedPlan` from the Debate Stage, providing a solid foundation.
        *   **Coder Bot (Worker 1):** Focuses on iterative code generation based on the refined plan.
        *   **Reviewer Bot (Worker 2):** Conducts structured code reviews, identifying issues and ensuring alignment with best practices.
    *   This turn-based, role-specific approach, now featuring a dedicated debate/planning phase, differentiates VibeCodeDuo from single-agent generation tools, promoting higher quality and more maintainable code.

*   **Stateful & Event-Driven Pipeline** 🌱🔄
    *   The backend orchestrator (`collaborationPipeline.ts`) manages the entire project lifecycle—tracking files (`projectFiles`), dependencies (`requiredPackages`), conversation history, and dynamically adjusting workflow based on AI feedback. This statefulness addresses context window limitations common in simpler AI coding tools.

*   **Unprecedented Transparency & Observability** 📡💬
    *   Tackling a key challenge of "vibe coding"—the "black box" nature of AI—VibeCodeDuo streams **all `PipelineEvent`s via Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
    *   **✨ Full AI Message Visibility:** Users see the *complete* textual output from AI agents (explanations, raw JSON, full code with syntax highlighting) directly in the chat, not just placeholders. This empowers users to understand and learn from the AI's decision-making process.
    *   A **"Code applied to editor"** indicator provides clear feedback on when generated code is integrated.

*   **IDE-Centric User Experience** 🖥️✨
    *   The frontend (`BuildInterface.tsx`) provides an immersive, IDE-like environment, displaying a live build process.
    *   Features include a dynamic file tree that updates in real-time (reflecting `scaffoldStage` and code generation), a multi-tab Monaco editor for viewing project files, and clear status updates via toasts and a persistent status bar.

## 🔥 Current Status & Achievements (feature/debate-stage-implementation Branch)

### 🔧 Backend (`/lib/orchestration/`, `/api/chat/route.ts`)

*   **✅ Fully Functional Orchestration Pipeline with Integrated Debate Stage:**
    *   **✨ `debateStage` Implementation & Integration:**
        *   Successfully implemented `debateStage.ts` where Debater A (Worker 1 config) and Debater B (Worker 2 config) discuss and refine implementation plans based on the `refinedPrompt`.
        *   A Summarizer AI (Refiner config) processes the debate into a structured JSON output: `summaryText`, `agreedPlan`, `options`, and `requiresResolution`.
        *   The `debateStage` is now integrated into `collaborationPipeline.ts`, running after `refineStage` and critically, *before* `scaffoldStage`.
    *   **✨ `scaffoldStage` Driven by Debate Outcome:** The `agreedPlan` (or `refinedPrompt` as fallback) from the `debateStage` is now the primary input for `scaffoldStage`, ensuring the project scaffold aligns with the collaboratively decided plan.
    *   Robust turn-based loop: Refiner ➔ **Debate (Proposer, Critiquer, Summarizer)** ➔ Scaffolder ➔ Coder ➔ Reviewer ➔ Revisions ➔ Installer.
    *   Intelligent review processing and dependency management (`installStage`).
*   **✅ Advanced LLM Service & JSON Parsing:**
    *   Resilient `extractJsonString` (used by `debateStage` and `scaffoldStage`) and `parseReviewOutput` handle diverse LLM outputs, ensuring reliable structured data processing.
*   **✅ Real-Time Streaming (SSE) & Stateful Context Management.**

### 🌐 Frontend (`/hooks/useBuildStream.ts`, `/components/ui/BuildInterface.tsx`, Zustand Stores)

*   **✨ Core "Vibe Coding" Enhancement: Full Chat Transparency & Debate Visibility:**
    *   **Complete AI Output Displayed:** AI chat bubbles show full explanations, raw JSON, or complete code blocks from all agents, including Debater A, Debater B, and the Summarizer.
    *   **Dedicated Debate Outcome Panel:** The UI now features a distinct section displaying the `debateSummaryText`, `agreedPlan`, `options`, and `requiresResolution` status, making the planning phase fully transparent.
    *   **"Code Applied" Indicator:** Visually confirms when AI-generated code is active in the editor.
*   **✅ Dynamic & Interactive UI:**
    *   `useBuildStream.ts` hook updated to process and manage new debate-related `PipelineEvents`.
    *   `BuildInterface.tsx` updated with new sender metadata and UI elements for the debate stage.
    *   Real-time file tree updates (from `scaffoldStage` & codegen).
    *   Multi-tab Monaco editor for project files.
    *   Syntax highlighting for all code (in editor and chat).
*   **✅ Robust State Management (Zustand) & User Feedback.**

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Next Steps

### ✅ **Recently Completed: `debateStage.ts` Integration (feature/debate-stage-implementation)**
*   **Achievement:** Successfully introduced and integrated a pre-coding planning phase (`debateStage.ts`) where AI agents (Debater A, Debater B, Summarizer) collaboratively discuss, critique, and refine implementation strategies. The `agreedPlan` from this stage now directly informs the `scaffoldStage`.
*   **Impact:** Significantly enhances upfront planning, aiming for improved architectural soundness and addressing a key aspect of robust software design.
*   **UI Visibility:** The debate process and its outcomes are now fully visible in the frontend interface.

### 🎈 Near-Term (Improving the Core "Vibe")
*   **Enhanced User Interaction:** Allow users to pause, provide feedback, or guide the AI mid-pipeline more effectively (e.g., during the debate if `requiresResolution` is true).
*   **User Customization:** Implement UI for per-role prompt control, allowing users to fine-tune AI behavior (e.g., reviewer strictness, coder verbosity, debater personas).
*   **Refine Scaffolding & Codegen from Debate:** Further optimize how `scaffoldStage` and `codegenStage` utilize the `agreedPlan` and `options` from the debate, especially for multi-file projects.
*   Address any minor UI warnings and continue refining LLM prompts for all stages.
